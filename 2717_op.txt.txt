I heard about 27:17 on Jocko's podcast and tried it. My shoulders and knees had been bothering me. After using 27:17 my knees are much better and my shoulder pain is rare! Anytime I have a minor injury I turn to 27:17 for prompt relief! ",

I am retired military of 21 years of service and I have put my body though a lot, this cream allows me to continue to do the tings I love. The cream is not a fix all but it really tries to be. I learned about h the cream through Jocko's podcast. I recommend this cream to everyone I cross paths with. The cream speaks for itself it works, maybe its a placebo but I don't care, plan and simple this shit works! Thank you Matt ",
