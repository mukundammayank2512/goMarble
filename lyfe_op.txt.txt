It is important for maintaining healthy bones and muscles. It plays a role in regulating the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the body, which are both essential for strong bones and boosting the immune system. Vitamin K2 Vitamin K2 is an often overlooked essential micronutrient. It plays an important role in cardiovascular and bone health by helping to remove calcium from the arteries and shuttle it into the bones where it belongs. Vitamin K2 also supports the immune system by boosting the production of antibodies and enhancing the function of the immune system's cells. Magnesium Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a key role in many bodily functions. Magnesium is involved in energy production, protein synthesis, and muscle function. Magnesium helps the body convert food into energy and plays a role in the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Zinc Zinc helps the body repair damaged tissues, which is especially important for athletes who often put their bodies under a great deal of stress and strain. Without enough zinc, athletes may experience a reduced ability to perform at their best and may be more susceptible to illness and injury. Choline Choline is a nutrient that is important for brain health. It helps to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is important for memory and learning. Choline is also important for the production of red blood cells. Vitamin B12 B12 is a water soluble vitamin that is essential for the body’s energy production. B12 supplementation is important for vegans and plant-based dieters who do not get enough through the diet. High doses of B12 may help to support cognitive function and a strong immune system. Selenium Selenium is important for the body because it helps promote the health of the thyroid gland and the reproductive system. The loss of nutrients in soil has resulted in a decrease of selenium levels in food, leading to rising incidences of selenium deficiency, a known cause of thyroid disorders. 0 / 0 ",
